repository for Cadence Bootcamp quests

## Chapter 1.0:
### Day 1.
1) Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words:
Blockchain - is a database (place, where we can store any data) that has no any 'owner' - so anyone can put his own data to this.

2) Explain what a Smart Contract is:
Smart Contract - is a kind of 'set of rules', that allows user to interact with a blockchain database - to make transactions and put data to blockchain.

3) Explain the difference between a script and a transaction:
Transaction - is a operation, that changes data in blockchain database. Every transaction costs some fee.
Script - is just some set of commands, that allows us to see a transactions in blockchain. Script doesn't cost any fee.

### Day 2.
1) What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?
 - Safety and Security
 - Clarity
 - Approachability
 - Developer Experience
 - Resource Oriented Programming
2) In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful:
I think, 5 Pillars allow to Cadence to be attractive for blockchain developers (especially pillar #2, #3, #4) and for users (pillar #1). So Cadence have perfect chances to become the most popular smart contract programming languages.
